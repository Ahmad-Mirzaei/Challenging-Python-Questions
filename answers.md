<p>When we put a semicolon at the end of a command and then write the next command, although it is in one line, Python calculates it as two separate commands, and we do not encounter a syntax error.</p>

4. Multiplication --> *
5. --> 43
6. --> Parentheses ( )

Here is the table of operator precedence in Python, listed from the highest to the lowest precedence:

| Precedence | Operator               | Description                                         |
|------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 1          | `()` (Parentheses)      | Parentheses always have the highest precedence.     |
| 2          | `**`                    | Exponentiation (Power)                             |
| 3          | `+`, `-`, `~`           | Unary plus, Unary minus, Bitwise NOT                |
| 4          | `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`     | Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulus  |
| 5          | `+`, `-`                | Addition and Subtraction                           |
| 6          | `<<`, `>>`              | Bitwise left shift, Bitwise right shift            |
| 7          | `&`                     | Bitwise AND                                        |
| 8          | `^`                     | Bitwise XOR                                        |
| 9          | `|`                     | Bitwise OR                                         |
| 10         | `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` | Comparison operators (equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to) |
| 11         | `not`                   | Logical NOT                                         |
| 12         | `and`                   | Logical AND                                         |
| 13         | `or`                    | Logical OR                                          |
| 14         | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `**=`, `//=` | Assignment operators                             |
| 15         | `is`, `is not`, `in`, `not in` | Identity and membership operators                |
| 16         | `lambda`                | Lambda (anonymous function)                        |

This table shows the operator precedence in Python, with the highest precedence at the top. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first, unless parentheses are used to alter the order of evaluation.

7. `int`, `str`, `list`, `dict`

### Explanation:
In Python, the main data types include:
- `int`: Integer
- `float`: Floating-point number
- `str`: String (text)
- `list`: List
- `tuple`: Tuple
- `dict`: Dictionary
- `set`: Set
- `bool`: Boolean (True or False)

There are no data types called `char`, `double`, `array`, or `numeric` in Python.
