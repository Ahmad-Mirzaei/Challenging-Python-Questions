General description :
    We want to solve challenging Python questions together. 
    Maybe on the way to the challenge, the answer to some questions requires searching on the Internet, 
    which makes progress and learning. So hello to Python...


history : 
    1. Python language was born in what year and by whom? 1. Python language was born in what year and by whom? In 1991 and by Guido van Rossum.

Applications of Python :
    2. What are the uses of Python?
    Uses of Python : 
        Big Data
        Mobile App
        Data Science
        Web Scripting
        Web Development
        Machin Learning
        Game Development
        Image processing
        Desktop programming
        Hacking and Security
        Artificial Intelligence
        and ...

syntax : 
    3. What is the output of the following code? and why?
        print("python"); print("programmer")
        # output :
            # python
            # programmer

    When we put a semicolon at the end of a command and then write the next command, 
    although it is in one line, Python calculates it as two separate commands and we do not encounter a syntax error.
